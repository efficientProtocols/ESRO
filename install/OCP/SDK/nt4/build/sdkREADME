You can build the examples and your own code either with the Neda tools using the
supplied Makefiles with Opus Make 6.0, or you can use the Visual C++ integrated
development environment (version 6.0 or above).


Building using the Neda tools 

Assuming you've unpacked the distribution into $(YOURDIR):

	cd $(YOURDIR)

	. ./win32setenv.sh

	cd examples/ops_xmpl.cb

	sh ./buildall.sh


Building using the Visual C++ IDE


Use the files 


	invoker/invoker.dsw 


and

	performer/performer.dsw


in

	$(YOURDIR)/examples/ops_xmpl.cb


NOTES ON A WEIRDNESS IN THE VISUAL C++ IDE

The first time you build either of the examples, the Visual C++ IDE environment fails to
perform a correct link. There are some 28 undefined references. But by simply running
'Build' a second time, the link works.

Seems like anomalous behavior to us. Check with Microsoft.
