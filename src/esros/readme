Notes on esros directories	           5/17/96
==================================================

There are two API models under which ESROS applications may be 
built for MSDOS: IMQ with getEvent API, and Direct callback API.
The following lists indicate which directories are associated
with which models.

1) IMQ with getEvent API

   user_sh
   prvdr_sh
   ops_xmpl.imq   
   stress.imq
   tester.imq

2) Direct callback API

   ops_xmpl.cb
   stress.cb

The remaining directories are independent of the process model.
